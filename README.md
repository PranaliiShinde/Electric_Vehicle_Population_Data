# Electric Vehicle Market Analysis
📌 Project Overview:

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Electric Vehicle (EV) market data to understand adoption trends, regional distribution, vehicle types, and manufacturer performance. The insights derived can help stakeholders, policymakers, and manufacturers make informed decisions to support the EV ecosystem.

🎯 Objectives
The analysis addresses the following key questions:

EV Adoption Trends: How has EV adoption grown over the years?

Regional Insights: Which states or cities have the highest EV registrations?

Manufacturer Performance: Which manufacturers lead in EV sales?

Vehicle Type Analysis: What is the distribution of EV types (Battery Electric Vehicles vs. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles)?

Environmental Impact: Estimation of CO₂ emissions reduction due to EV adoption.

📂 Dataset
